# Simulate an AXI4-Lite Peripheral using VIvado Simulator

When designing hardware we want to verify the circuit generated by our compilers.

Two steps to do this is 
* Simulating the circuit pre generation
* Probing the signals with a logic analyzer (internal or external to the FPGA)

  * The ILA (Integrated Logic Analyzer) is a tool for in hardware debugging.
It needs to be generated in fabric as a memory sampling certain signals with 

  * Becuase of this, it’s best practice to write a test bench to simulate IP cores before implementation.
Simulation of an AXI4 IPcore requires emulating the signals on the AXI bus for write and read transactions.
