The Integrated Logic Analyzer is a very powerful tool for debugging hardware.

Becuase of this, itâ€™s best practice to write a test bench to simulate IP cores before implementation.
Simulation of an AXI4 IPcore requires emulating the signals on the AXI bus for write and read transactions.

Creating a AXI4 IP testbench and running simulation.


Chapter 1: Project Preparation

Step 1: Create new Project in Vivado

Step 2: Create and Package new IP - Create a new AXI4 peripheral - Edit in IP Packager


Peripheral interface:|
------------ | -------------
Type:| Lite
Mode:| Slave
Data width (Bits):| 32
Number of registers:| 4


Chapter 2: Test Strategy

For our purpose we would like to simulate writing values, via the AXI bus, to the slave register

Write a testbench where the AXI4 signals are manipulated in a reusable sequence like a function that takes an argument and drives signals accordingly.

again and again in the main body of code

a single reusable sequence of code that takes an argument and drives signals accordingly.


First step in writing a AXI4 testbench is to define all the signals used by the AXI4-lite interface.
